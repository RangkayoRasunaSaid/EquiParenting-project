This project is the final project of [BOOTCAMP] Perempuan Inovasi 2023 - Full Stack Web Development, a collaboration program between Markoding and Magnifique Indonesia and the Dian Sastrowardoyo Foundation. The boot camp provides digital skills training scholarships for women in Indonesia, especially the underprivileged. Participants are equipped with industry-relevant skills to develop innovations to solve gender-related problems in their environment, such as violence against women, sexual harassment, child marriage, and gender equality.

## Project Overview

EquiParenting is a web application aimed at empowering parents or any other providers in the family to be more present in the household, especially for parenting. The project focuses on promoting gender equality by encouraging active participation from all family members in household chores and parenting responsibilities. It addresses issues such as parenting, domestic violence, bullying of children, divorce, and cases of depression that can lead to loss of life.

## Key Features

1. **Mission Management:** Users can create, view, and manage household chores or tasks within specified periods. Each task can be assigned to a specific member of the family, and details such as title, category, description, start and end dates, and points can be specified.
2. **Period Management:** Users can set the start and end dates for mission periods, defining specific timeframes during which household chores should be completed.
3. **Reward System:** Upon completing all tasks within a specified period and earning a 100% score, the member becomes eligible to claim a reward. This feature encourages active participation and acknowledges the efforts of family members.
4. **Scoring and Approval:** The application includes a scoring mechanism to track task completion and calculate each member's score within a period. Members can approve completed tasks, promoting accountability and collaboration.
5. **Comprehensive View:** The project provides a comprehensive view of past activities and reward periods, helping users track their progress and achievements over time.
